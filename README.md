# Booking-app-with-firebase
App scheduler built with html css js on the front end.
Firebase on the backend
Easy structure if you want to replicate:
Create your files (Index.html, style.css, app.js, db.js)
Register with firebase and create new project
command line prompts using npm: firebase expo, firebase init, firebase serve, firebase install -g, firebase deploy
:)
